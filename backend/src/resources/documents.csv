1,"The DuckDB CLI (Command Line Interface) is a single, dependency free executable. It is precompiled for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Please see the installation page under the CLI tab, or download the version for your environment from the DuckDB GitHub releases page (in the “Assets” section)."
2,"Once the CLI executable has been downloaded, unzip it and save it to any directory. Navigate to that directory in a terminal and enter the command duckdb to run the executable. If in a PowerShell or POSIX shell environment, use the command ./duckdb instead. To see additional command line options to use when starting the CLI, use the command duckdb --help. By default, the CLI will open a temporary in-memory database. To open or create a persistent database, simply include a path as a command line argument like duckdb path/to/my_database.duckdb. This path can point to an existing database or to a file that does not yet exist and DuckDB will open or create a database at that location as needed. The file may have any arbitrary extension, but .db or .duckdb are two common choices. You will see a prompt like the below, with a D on the final line."
